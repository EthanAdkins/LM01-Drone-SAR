<!-- CONDA ENV -->
## Managing CONDA environments

To ensure consistent testing, this is where we will put the conda environments we are using. It's best to use the Anaconda Navigator because it has a GUI!

### Importing Environments
1. Download the .yaml file from here
2. Go to your Anaconda Navigator
3. Under Environments, select "Import" then select the .yaml file environment you want to be imported

### Exporting Environments
1. In Anaconda Navigator, go to Environments
2. Select the Environment you want to export, and then select "Backup"
3. Save it somewhere in your local computer, then push it to this repo


<!-- Settings Config for AirSim -->
## Settings Config for AirSim
Several settings might be used when testing with AirSim, so we will also keep those settings.json here (for reinforcement learning at least)

### Customizing settings.json
1. To locate your settings.json, go to "C:\Users\xxxx\Documents\AirSim"
2. Change the contents of the json file by copy-pasting.
p.s. config for lidar testing is not yet final
